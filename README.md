## Exercise 🏋️‍♀️

The idea of this project is to implement a small client application for discovering trending
repositories on GitHub.

- A list of the repositories created in the last 7 days with the most number of stars in github
  should be displayed and the user should be able to favourite them;
- The favourited repositories should be visible either through a filter or in a different tab. Some
  basic info about the repo should be displayed, such as: repo name, link to GitHub, description and
  number of stars.
- To keep things simple, the favourites won’t be sent back to GitHub’s servers but just stored
  locally (e.g localstorage, cookies etc...).

> 🍎 Bonus task: if time allows, the ability to filter the repos by the languages used would be an
> awesome addition to have.
